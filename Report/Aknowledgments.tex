\textit{First of all, I would like to thank Pr. Jukka Pekola for having accepted me within the PICO Group and having given me the possibility to do this internship. Of course this would not have been possible without Dr. Clemens Winckelmann who gave me Pr. Pekola contact details. Then, I will of course thank the whole PICO Group for having integrated me so well and helped me when I needed it, but especially Dr. Mathieu Taupin who I worked with on plasma etching project and who gave me precious advices about clean room processes and laboratory methods, alongside with Dr. Matthias Meschke on that last point. Finally, I would like to thank both \textsc{Grenoble INP Phelma} for having given me the opportunity to do such an internship and Aalto University which made it possible afterall.}
